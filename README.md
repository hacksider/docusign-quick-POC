   With embedded signing, the DocuSign signing is initiated from your website.
1. **Send an envelope with a remote (email) signer and cc recipient.**
   [Source.](./lib/eSignature/eg002SigningViaEmail.js)
   The envelope includes a pdf, Word, and HTML document.
   Anchor text ([AutoPlace](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/AutoPlace-New-DocuSign-Experience)) is used to position the signing fields in the documents.
1. **List envelopes in the user's account.**
   [Source.](./lib/eSignature/eg003ListEnvelopes.js)
1. **Get an envelope's basic information.**
   [Source.](./lib/eSignature/eg004EnvelopeInfo.js)
   The example lists the basic information about an envelope, including its overall status.
1. **List an envelope's recipients** [Source](./lib/eSignature/eg005EnvelopeRecipients.js)<br />
   Includes current recipient status.

## Authentication types:

* Authentication with Docusign via [Authorization Code Grant flow](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode) .
When the token expires, the user is asked to re-authenticate.
The **refresh token** is not used in this example.

* Authentication with DocuSign via the [JSON Web Token (JWT) Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/).
When the token expires, it updates automatically.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
**Note: If you downloaded this code using Quickstart from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip items 1 and 2 below as they're automatically performed for you.**

1. A DocuSign developer account (email and password) on [demo.docusign.net](https://demo.docusign.net). 
  If you don't already have one, create a [free account](https://go.docusign.com/sandbox/productshot/?elqCampaignId=16534).

1. A DocuSign integration key (client ID). To use [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/), you will need an integration key and its secret key. To use [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/), you will need an integration key, an RSA key pair, and an account ID for the user you are impersonating.  

   If you use this example on your own workstation,
   the Integration key must include a **Redirect URI** of `http://localhost:5000/ds/callback`

   If you will not be running the example on your own workstation,
   use the appropriate DNS name and port instead of `localhost`

1. [Node.js version 8.10 or later with NPM version 5 or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
1. A name and email for a signer, and a name and email for a cc recipient.
   The signer and the cc email cannot be the same.

### Installation steps
**Note:** If you downloaded this code using Quickstart from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip items 1 and 4 below as they're automatically performed for you.

1. Download or clone this repository to your workstation to directory **code-examples-node**
1. Switch to the folder: `cd <Quickstart_folder_name>` or `cd code-examples-node`
1. `npm install`   
1. Copy the file config/appsettings.example.json into a file config/appsettings.json<br /> 
   *Either:*
   * Update the file config/appsettings.json in the project's root directory
     with the Integration Key and other settings, *or*
   * Create and export environment variables for the settings. See the config/appsettings.json file
     for the names of the environment variables.
   **Note:** Protect your integration key and secret--If you update the config/appsettings.json file, then you
   should ensure that it will not be stored in your source code repository.
1. `npm start`
1. Open a browser to http://localhost:5000

### Configuring JWT
1. Create a developer account on developers.docusign.com if you don't already have one.
1. Create a new API key in the Admin panel: https://admindemo.docusign.com/api-integrator-key, take note of the public key.
1. Set a redirect URI of `http://localhost:5000/ds/callback` as mentioned in the installation steps above for the integration key you create in Prerequisites item 2.
1. Generate an RSA key pair in the administrator console on the DocuSign developer account and copy the private key to a secure location.
1. Create a new file in your repo source folder named private.key, and paste in that copied RSA private key, then save it.
1. Update the file config/appsettings.json and include the newly created API key from item 2 as well as your account user id GUID which is also found on the Admin panel: `https://admindemo.docusign.com/api-integrator-key`.

From there you should be able to run the launcher using `npm start` then selecting **JSON Web Token** when authenticating your account.


## Payments code example
To use the payments example, create a test payments gateway for your DocuSign developer account. 

See the 
[PAYMENTS_INSTALLATION.md](./code-examples-node/blob/master/PAYMENTS_INSTALLATION.md)
file for instructions.
   
Then add the payment gateway account id to the config/appsettings.json file.


## Unit Testing

1. Before running the unit tests you will need to [obtain an Access Token](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/authcode-get-token/)
and you will need an API Account ID.

2. *Either:*

   * Update the file **test/testHelpers.js** in the project's root directory
     with the Access Token, API Account ID, signer and cc information *or*
   * Create and export this information as the environment variables named in that file.

3. npm test
